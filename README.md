  A Turing School Mod 4 Project

# About The Project

Never Alone is an application that allows people to check in on each other. The target audience is people caring for someone who is elderly or who is living with a disability, but it could also be utilized for anyone who wants to be able to check in on a friend or family member.

The aim of the application is to allow a user to quickly check in on how someone is doing, and if they have remembered a task such as taking medications, without being intrusive. Users can set times for check-ins and see if they are accomplished within a set time each day simply by checking their screen at any time.

This was a group project for the Turing School of Software and Design. The Front End of the project is being discussed here, and the Back End can be accessed from the repository. We were able to select a project we wished to work on from suggestions put forward by our peers. The idea for this project came from Ian Holliday, who is one of the developers for the project. Since this application seems best suited to be used from a phone or mobile device, we chose to work with React Native and Expo, which were new technologies for everyone on the team.

## Built with

  - JavaScript
  - React
  - React Native
  - Expo
  - Babel

## Installation

In your terminal:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/never-alone-turing/FE.git`
2. Install NPM packages: `npm install`
3. If you are using Expo: `expo start` to open whichever simulator you prefer, or run `npm start` to open in your browser.

If you are using the Expo app, a QR code will display, that can be scanned to open the app on your phone.

If you are using an Android simulator, you will need to have Android Studio downloaded on your computer. If you are using a MAC, you will need to have XCode downloaded to use the Iphone simulator


## Challenges

Although we were familiar with React and CSS, React Native was a new technology, and using Expo meant that we were not using the dev tools that we were accustomed to, so there was a bit of a learning curve, but it was not too difficult to work in the new framework.
Members of the team were in three different time zones, so two of the members needed to make accommodations to work with the rest of the team.

## Successes

Working on a project that we chose, rather than one that was assigned was definitely a positive experience.
